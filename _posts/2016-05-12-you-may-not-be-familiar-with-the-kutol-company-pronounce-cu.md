You may not be familiar with the Kutol company (pronounce cut-all) but you certainly know an off-spring product of theirs. 

In 1912, Kutol created a wallpaper cleaner that was effective at removing the soot created by fireplaces. The product was a big hit. As the Great Depression began in 1929 and electric heat became more prevalent in American homes, sales began to diminish. The once cash cow product was fast becoming obsolete. It wasn't until the 1950's, a preschool teacher complained to her brother-in-law that the modeling clay her children were using was too hard. He sent her a sample of his company's non-toxic doughy substance and in 1956, the world was introduced to Play-doh. 

Today's companies are less industry categorical then ever before. NAICS and SIC codes don't tell even half of what many companies do. For example, what is Amazon? Are they a book retailer? E-commerce company? Distributor? Technology company? Communications firm? They are all the above and more.

There is heavy pressure on today's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Marketing Officer to work together to pave the way for an organization's future. There are 3 things in which this dynamic duo will first focus their efforts in building this fountain of youth business machine.

**1\. Identify innovative and operationally-minded individuals.**It used to be the case that you wouldn't find the words operational and innovative in the same sentence. However, as eBay CEO Meg Whitman points out, "Ideas have always been the lifeblood of business; the difference now is, from idea to realization of that idea to actually being in business has gone from years to potentially days." 

**2\. Develop a change mission of forward-thinking entrepreneurship.**Change missions are established to set a tone for the company, not a specific pathway in which to arrive at the goal. With the right leader in place, the result is often far better and more well-rounded than what the leaders had or could have imagined. 

**3\. Create a communications cadence of progress.**This provides accountability in a non-threatening environment while allowing for refinement of ideas and progress. Established from the top, it immediately sets a level of importance and investment on the change mission. 

Had these areas of focus been implemented for established companies, one could wonder if TV Guide would have been our version of YouTube or if Blockbuster would have survived to be our now-known Netflix and RedBox. 

In a couple of weeks Google will begin opening the process of allowing cities to bid on becoming the first Google municipalities with the highest-speed Internet, self-driving cars, drone delivery and many more of the new Jetsons-like futurama. In 2000 would you have ever thought a search engine could accomplish this?

Your first mistake was thinking of them as a search engine.
